  <p>The Journalarium is a new podcast from Paul Newham, the British pioneer of expressive psychology who has spent four decades examining the stories we weave in our attempt to make sense of the world, illuminating that liminal space between myth and history, science and psyche, where imaginal transformation and creative regeneration occurs.    </p>
  <p>According to many storytellers, there is a place, nestled between the baking Arabian Desert to the south and the icy Zagros Mountains to the North, called The Journalarium.
    It was here that thousands of secret texts, including personal diaries and journals penned by luminaries and mystics, were deposited by traveling merchants charged with protecting irreplaceable writings from those who sought to destroy them.    </p>
  <p>So it was that the Journalarium came to symbolize a coveted crucible of truth and wisdom.    </p>
  <p>The archives deposited at the Journalarium contain a codex of information drawn from the codified traditions of disparate first cultures, from Asia to Africa, from Europe to the Pacific.    This documents what we today identify as Indigenous Science, or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). </p>
  <p>While the impenetrable rocky walls of the unchartered Journalarium loom obscured by clouds fathoms above sea level, this legendary library also represents an interior font of insight, which has evolved specifically in response to the unique habitat of each native community to become their law of life, and the lore of their folk.    </p>
  <p>Today, there is renewed interest in the Indigenous Science of this Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), as we embrace the humility that comes with recognizing how our own Western Modern Science (WMS) has wreaked irreparable damage in the wake of its achievements.    </p>
  <p>Yet if we are to truly understand and incorporate the wisdom of indigenous science into our western way of thinking and acting, we must do more than adulate the lyrical allure of the Journalarium.
    We must learn and accept an entirely unfamiliar framework of perception and interpretation as equal in validity to the one we have come to equate with reason.    </p>
  <p>For at the heart of the Journalarium, and at the core of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), is a science that pivots around incontrovertible and inviolate regard for the relational dynamics between everyone and everything.
    And this science is in turn predicated on recognizing the imperative place of the sacred in all we do.    </p>
  <p>This notion of the sacred clearly differentiates between indigenous and western modern perceptions of progress.
    And the Journalarium is in itself a trove of sacred knowledge.</p>
  <p> In this podcast, Paul Newham combines probing journalism with captivating storytelling to trace the evolution of indigenous science and elucidate the principles of ecological wisdom, as he takes listeners on a tour through the echoing corridors of the Journalarium, in search of the sacred threads that weave us together and connect us to the cosmos of which we are a tiny part. </p>
